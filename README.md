The goal of Task 2 was to automate the generation of a PDF report from data stored in a file (specifically, a CSV file). Using Python, I had to read the data, perform basic analysis, and create a formatted PDF report using a library like FPDF or ReportLab.

Tools and Libraries Used:

pandas: For data loading and processing.

fpdf: For generating and formatting the final PDF document.

Approach: I started by creating a CSV file named data.csv which contained simple student records with columns like Name, Age, and Marks. The Python script first read this file using pandas, which made data analysis easy and efficient. I calculated the total number of students, the average age, the average marks, and identified the student with the highest and lowest scores.

After analyzing the data, I used the fpdf library to design a clean and structured PDF report. The report included a title, summary statistics, and a table listing all student records. The formatting was kept simple, with consistent fonts, alignment, and headers.

Output and Report Details: The generated output file was named student_report.pdf. It contained:

A title: “Student Performance Report”

A short summary section with:

Total students

Average marks and age

Top and lowest scorers

A table listing all student names, ages, and marks

The PDF was automatically generated in the project directory upon script execution.

Learning Outcomes:

Learned to automate the process of reading and analyzing data using pandas.

Gained experience in generating structured documents using the fpdf library.

Understood the importance of automated reporting in real-world applications such as business dashboards, school reports, and data-driven workflows.

Appreciated how Python can be used to reduce repetitive work and ensure consistency in reporting.

Conclusion: This task demonstrates the power of automation in data analysis and reporting. By combining pandas for backend analysis and fpdf for frontend PDF generation, I built a lightweight reporting tool that could be extended to larger datasets or more advanced formats. It’s a practical skill that has applications in education, business, and personal analytics.
